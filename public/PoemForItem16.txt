1000 things made only to be made
1000 things that fail the passing grade
3 things a day: our debt we pay to you,
our humble viewer, yearning for the new.
For when quality is in decline,
quantity will do just fine.
But this is not the time to brag
we’ve not yet filled our shitty bag!
There’s room enough for many more,
At least 984.
So back we go, to toil away
and make some shit for another day.
